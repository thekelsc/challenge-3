# Password Generator - Challenge 3

Password Generator

In this Challenge Assignment for the UofU-VIRT-BO-FSF-PT-10-2020-U-B-TTH Coding Bootcamp Due Sunday 11/15/2020 at 11:59 pm, I was tasked with modifying existing starter code to create a random password of 8-128 characters between upper and lower case characters, including special characters. 

Was also expected to allow the submitter to select certain criteria. 

The code base is stable and does generate a secure random password of the requested character expectations, however it does not yet tie to the users requested inputs. Unfortunately due to time constraints and other committments, there was not an opportunity for further programming.
